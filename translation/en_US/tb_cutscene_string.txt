Mom! Mom! I did it! I even got top marks!

I'll save you, mom... no! Please! NOOO!!!

At the age of just 18, you won the Game of the Year award. How do you feel?

ID=100202
That must've happened while I wasn't paying attention. I can catch a big fish in my sleep!

ID=100203
This amazing game, written by a regular high school student, has been ranked #1 for 20 consecutive weeks!

ID=100204
With him being one of the 100 most influential people on the planet, he refused every interview until this very day.

ID=100205
Oh man. Oh god, this world is such a bore.

ID=100206
Most major cities have been destroyed by The Great Void, along with millions of people either killed or missing.

ID=100207
Great Void.. well that is something new. I should take a closer look at that.

ID=100208
How dreadfully... exciting! What are you exactly? Tell me!

ID=100209
Come on, out with it already!

ID=100210
Alright, fine! Swallow me up then. I'll find out myself!

ID=100301
Do you mean that thing which appeared nearby?

ID=100302
I'm not sure what that is exactly.

ID=100303
Anyways, I have something else to tell you! I went shopping today and...

ID=100304
Err.. what's going on?

ID=100305
Why is it so loud in the middle of the night?

ID=100306
Huh?! No... Aaaaah!

ID=100307
What... what are you?!

ID=100308
Spit him out! Give me back my brother!

ID=100309
*sob* Ah... aaah... aaaaaaah...!!

ID=100310
Ha.. ha.. hahaha! Ahahahahahaha!

ID=100401
Three months have passed since the Great Void appeared.

ID=100402
Most major cities have been destroyed by The Great Void, along with millions of people either killed or missing.

ID=100403
Are we all really safe here?

ID=100404
Yes, this is a safe zone. I promise!

ID=100405
Alright.. I trust you.

ID=100406
Well then! I've been a member of the rescue team for 2 months and have nothing but accolades to my name! Hahaha!

ID=100407
The Great Void! The Great Void! It has appeared... in our safe haven!

ID=100408
You said we'd be safe here! Wh-wh-why...?

ID=100409
It's all... because of me... It's all my fault!

ID=100410
I... I have to save them. I have to!

ID=100411
Don't do it! You'll die!

ID=100412
Ahhhhhh!!

ID=100501
Why did you come to this town?!

ID=100502
They all died because of you, all because of your curse!

ID=100503
N.. no, it's not... my fault.

ID=100504
Why are you doing this to us?

ID=100505
Is it really all my fault? Should I not be in this world?

ID=100506
I am so sorry. Now I'm all alone again.

ID=100507
Old man, will we be alone there as well?

ID=100508
After all, there's no one there to hate me.

ID=100509
I don't want to be sad anymore.

ID=100601
Iris! Don't even think about going out to play!

ID=100602
But my friends are waiting for me...

ID=100603
I'm about to lose my cool!

ID=100604
Alright, fine, I understand.

ID=100605
Where did you learn that nasty stuff?

ID=100606
But he was messing with my friend, Marie!

ID=100607
Why can't you be more like your sisters?!

ID=100608
Why must you always go dragging the name of the Yuma clan through the mud?

ID=100609
But... I don't want to be like them!

ID=100610
I don't need a family. I wish you'd all just disappear!

ID=100611
Warning! Warning! Evacuate to the shelter immediately!

ID=100612
I repeat! Evacuate to the shelter immediately!

ID=100613
Wh-what's that?

ID=100614
Noooo! Mommy! Daddy! Sisters!

ID=100615
Aaaaahh!

ID=100616
I didn't really mean it!

ID=100617
Why did you make them all disappear?!

ID=100618
You evil bastard!

ID=201103
Remember this. You are me, and I am you.

ID=201201
We are one and two. Two and one.

ID=201202
As a proof of my holy oath... I'll protect you.

ID=201203
Don't forget. Me and my brother are one.

ID=201204
So... try to find me a little faster. It's a promise.

As proof of the holy oath, I'll protect you.

ID=201503
Please don't forget. We are one.

ID=201504
So promise me. To make sure you'll find me.

Don't forget. That we were one.

ID=201604
So please. Make sure...  you find me again.

ID=201002
What is this...!!

ID=201003
Wake up, you can't fall down here!

ID=202001
What are you doing.

ID=202002
Edgar, you're here!

ID=202003
Fill this world with dolls, to make you the king of this world!

ID=202004
No need for that.

ID=202005
What?

ID=202006
I'm not interested in being a king. 

ID=202007
I'm just a clown who is satisfied by making her smile.

ID=202008
Edgar... what are you talking about?

ID=202009
I guess it was a mistake to give you this role.

ID=202010
and your way is too ugly. Useless items should be discarded.

ID=202011
Edgar... Edgar!!!

ID=203101
You want to save her?

ID=203102
But... She is only allowed to rest for now.

ID=203103
If you promise to be with me forever... I'll give you the power.

ID=203104
The strength to rest.

ID=203105
I promise! Give me the power... 

ID=203106
I don't... want to do this anymore...!

ID=203107
I swear... It's done here now.

ID=203108
Ahhhh!!

ID=203201
Hey bro. you look in trouble, need a help?

ID=203202
I have good news. I got the strength to give that child rest.

ID=203203
But it's not free like everything.

ID=203204
I'll give you the strength if you promise to be with me.

ID=203205
A great power.

ID=203206
What do you think? Do you have any ideas?

ID=203207
Even if the devil comes out, I swear!

ID=203208
Give it to me. Give me the power!

ID=203209
I knew it would. The oath is established!

ID=203210
Ughahhh!!

ID=203301
He's not dead, that child. You want to get it done completely, right?

ID=203302
But what am I supposed to do? You wouldn't be able to do it now with your ability~

ID=203303
Swear to me that you want power.

ID=203304
Then I'll give you the power to completely end that child.

ID=203305
I'll... accept the deal. Give me... strength.

ID=203306
I got it. Forever here and now, I promise.

ID=203307
Ahhhh!!

ID=203401
Do you want to save that girl?

ID=203402
But you already know.

ID=203403
The only way to save that girl is, to give her rest.

ID=203404
So if you promise me, I'll give you the power.

ID=203405
I promise! And I will... bear the guilt!

ID=203406
With your wishes, the oath has been established.

ID=203407
Ughahhh!!

ID=203501
Just like I said, right? You'll be sad.

ID=203502
If she stays still like this, the child will continue suffering. You don't want that, right?

ID=203503
Promise me. If you promise, you'll gain power.

ID=203504
The power to save that child from sadness!

ID=203505
I'll do it, I'll do it... I'll do everything!

ID=203506
I don't want to do it anymore!

ID=203507
Alright. Forever here and now... I promise!

ID=203601
That child can't come back anymore...

ID=203602
All we can do for you, is to let you sleep quietly like this.

ID=203603
If you truly want to end this tragedy, swear an oath to me.

ID=203604
Tell me you want more strength...

ID=203605
Give me your strenght... ! I swear, so give it to me... !

ID=203606
Give me all of your strenght!

ID=203607
The contract has been established…

ID=203608
Now… Do as you wish…

ID=203609
Ughahhh!!

ID=203001
Thank you…

ID=204001
Shion… We finally met.

ID=205001
No, Shion. Wake up! Wake up... Shion!

ID=205002
Shion!!!

ID=206001
Stop, another fate.

ID=206002
It's not time for you to be here.

ID=206003
Go back to the air.

ID=206004
It'll be here soon, a time of true awakening.

ID=206005
Oh... no!

ID=206006
The time has come for the two cogs to mesh, and the axis of the world will turn.

ID=206007
May you not fail.

ID=401001
The pride of Nihil Kingdom is the loyalty to the royal family!\nThe loyalty of Nihil Kingdom is the pride of me!

ID=401002
Blue-eyed warriors, though many of you may not remember your sacrifice./n Be a proud member of the children's hymn and story to be the history of the eternal royal family!

ID=401003
My name is Arua! The Ten Commandments of the Proud Country of Niheal Kingdom!

ID=401004
We punish those who interfere with the noble march of our Blue Knights!\nWe came to satisfy your thirst for revenge with your red blood!

ID=401005

ID=700001
Dad… Dad…

ID=700002
Catherine? Are you okay?

ID=700003
Dad… Where are you?

ID=700004
Yes, this is Catherine! Come this way!

ID=700005
C...Catherine…! Catherine!!!

ID=302001
For people.\nIf you have learned something, you are inadvertently relying on that knowledge in a hurry.

ID=302002
If your arm falls off your body, you will burn yourself. If you learn this proposition repeatedly.

ID=302003
The premise that the arm has fallen from the body leads to the conclusion that it is an alter ego without any doubt.

ID=302004
So, did you ask me to cut off my arm just because I wanted to trick people?

ID=302005
Really… I'm not sane.

ID=302006
Haha, nothing is as boring as being sane!

ID=302007
How about you too? Wouldn't it be more fun to live like this?

ID=302008
No, it's enough for me to be bored.

ID=302009
That's not funny.

ID=301001
Mr. Erwin... Mr. Erwin?

ID=301002
Well, I finally found out.\nWhy I felt bad, what I was mistaking... I get it all!

ID=301003
These people... these people in this space... It's all blank...\nIt wasn't human, it was part of the void!

ID=301004
I had to kill them all! All of them!

ID=301005
Aha... Aha ha ha ha...

ID=301006
As expected, I wasn't wrong.

ID=301007
I told you, that smile on your face suits you well...
