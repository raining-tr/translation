ID=15005

The clown's invitation points to an abandoned plaza.\nWhat presents are there waiting for you?

ID=15006

Puppets that filled the streets of the square.\nThe streets that once were full of people are now/nthe streets of dolls that have no mind.

ID=15007

To prevent the Big Puppet from advancing, you need a helicopter supported by Ned Company. The dolls must be stopped before they destroy the helicopter.

ID=15008

Operation [The shield]. It's a dangerous operation to lure Big Puppets to self-destruct inside a barrier. This operation must be successful.

ID=15009

The power of the new dolls./nAnd the searchers who went to investigate them are still not coming back. I felt an ominous energy.

ID=15010

People who have become dolls, ominous towers and busy dolls...\nWhy do dolls build towers?

ID=15011

It was the tower that made people into dolls.\nBenjamin ordered the destruction of the towers that the dolls built up before the damage continued.

ID=15012

Talking Doll, Codename [Jack the King].\nThe only way to get around this situation is to kill Jack The King.

ID=15013

Finally, the tailed [Clown of the Infestation].\nIt was an abandoned hospital near Rocco Town. Find the starting line and track down the Blue Clown.

ID=15014

I learned that to reach the Clown of the Black Flame, I needed to get a special token.\nThe sign is held by the subordinates in the hospital.

ID=15015

Arrived at the area where the Clown of the Black Flame was located. Through the sign, he can only reach him through the magnetic field.

ID=15016

The runaway blue clown, Edgar, invited him to the hospital's rooftop circus tent as the final battlefield.\nThe final battle, you must kill him.

ID=15017

Defeat the Soul Junks on the coastal roads to secure the supply route for Candus City, which began as soon as it came to the new city.

ID=15018

News from Ned Company mercenaries confirmed that there was still a strong Soul Junk on the coastal road.\nYou're always angry...

ID=15019

Recently, an unknown earthquake is occurring on coastal roads. There is a risk of overpass or building collapse, so you need to find out the cause of the earthquake.

ID=15020

Soul Junk's group appears again. Colonel Aaron kills Soul Junks for the defense of Candus City and directs the demolition of the coastal tunnel, the only supply route.

ID=15021

Underground waters with Ned Company's permission.\nExtreme odor made you breathless.\nIt really feels like something is here.

ID=15022

In all parts of the city, odors from groundwater channels began to smell. It's clear that the stench killer is in the underground channel.

ID=15023

In the Ned Company, mercenaries and researchers were sent to underground waterways on a large scale. Feeling something suspicious with their moves, Brock directs them to watch.

ID=15024

The appearance of Junk Knight shocked everyone in the Star Forest League. Brock asks Ned Company to get a sample of Junk Knight for the purpose.

ID=15025

Ned Company found out that he had crashed into a nearby mansion trying to transfer something by transport.\nYou should investigate what they were trying to transport.

ID=15026

The entire mansion has turned into a Soul Junk den.\nThere is a powerful contagious Soul Junk, so you should kill him before you go out.

ID=15027

Ralph said Catherine was supposed to be deep inside the mansion. Find Catherine and go deep inside the mansion.

ID=15028

Aragnis, who abducted Catherine, is now hiding deep inside the mansion.\nYou have to find Catherine soon.

ID=15029

The only antidote to save Catherine from Bain Bane is now inside Ned Company's lab, but the lab was already a Soul Junk den.

ID=15030

Inside the second lab was also a den of Soul Junk. I don't know what made it this way, but now Catherine's antidote comes first.

ID=15031

Victor felt guilty for the missing Catherine and went deep into the lab in search of an antidote.\nYou have to find him before the Soul Junk finds him.

ID=15032

Henry directs the lab's blast, saying that the antidote requires proper use of non-holder mucus.

ID=15033

Immediately after returning from Rocco Town, a huge number of Soul Junks attacked Candus City. Open and close the shelter to help evacuate people.

ID=15034

A large number of Soul Junks were found on the way to the transport, inside the shelter. You must kill people before they get attacked.

ID=15035

Most of the inhabitants were evacuated and only Catherine and us remained. And then we witnessed a number of Soul Junks heading for the transport.

ID=15036

Behind Candus City and we started to escape.\nBut Soul Junk has been persistently raiding the ship, and all were insecure.

ID=15037

At this time Henry was busy chasing, he was ordered to experience Betsy. I have no choice but to do it right now.

ID=15038

Betsy, Rapid Flame, worshiping the desire for power. Rapid Flame's assault squads are looking for an invasion of Grace City on the freeway.

ID=15039

A vehicle was suspected to have Henry. The question is full, but the important thing is that he has to save him before he gets hit by the Betsy first.

ID=15040

Henry, the revenge target, disappeared and Rapid Flame's exec [Ska] appears on the highway. In order to know where Henry is, he must be stopped to locate his where abouts.

ID=15041

After Henry entered the Ned Company's headquarters, there was an urgent news that Rapid Flame's raids captured the Ned Company building. Unwilling but must rescue him.

ID=15042

Ned Company's power supply is not smooth due to the rapid flame that has already occupied the building.

ID=15043

To restore the power of the Ned Company, the power inside the building must be operated manually. Obviously, the key will be the Rapid Flames, which are currently occupying the building.

ID=15044

To get evidence of what Henry did in Candus City, he had to copy all the data from the security box inside the Ned Company.

ID=15045

Operation to stop Rapid Flame's raid units invading Second Highway, and Wolf Cry, must be secured by Hill Breaker's shooting location.

ID=15046

Operation Cry Wolf Cry is a high-frequency missile, Final Aria, that destroys Queen Garura, the flagship force.

ID=15047

Hill Breaker cannot move to the Aria missile launch point. Along with Star Forest League's Soul Worker Kainbarrel, you must stop the raids of the Rapid Flames.

ID=15048

Hello,\nEdgar, a humble clown searching for the best show in a scrambled world.\nI think you are surprised by sending this letter suddenly. I wanted to express it.\nYour power is the most beautiful and impressive I saw in my short life.\nIt was simple with simplicity, ugly with beauty,\nwas calm and destructive.\nI thought a lot about how I would express my feelings.\nI decided to send you a small gift.\nI am honoring you for your strength, so please do not refuse.\nYou can find it at a place that you humans call a shopping street. I hope you like it.\n-Posted by a Clown 

ID=33001

It feels like you're getting closer to me.\nI don't believe we'll be able to meet any time soon,\nThe longer you wait, the greater the chance of meeting.\nPrepare a small game for dramatic situations.\nYou can't pass the room in front of my room right now.\nBut if you have a token from my men,\nyou can make it pass through the forest at dawn.\nPlease hurry up.\nBefore this heart that awaits you is turned into hatred.\n-The Clown Ed

-Report: Amaryllis-\n\n1. Added Soul Energy Immunity to SJ-DS-01. The state is very unstable.\N\n2. SJ-DS-01 has been found to be parasitic to humans, a host of soul energy.\nPeople who are parasitic are constantly deprived of soul energy, and their skin becomes hard like gypsum\nSn-DS-01 It works.\n\n3. Named the SJ-DS-01 as a signature snatcher. It turns out that there is a total amount of Soul Energy stored inside the DIGITAL Snatcher. However, ordinary humans do not have enough Soul Energy to fill the entire amount. Current total amount is not measurable.

Report: Tempest-\n1. The body is composed of precise machines. Based on the skill of the Rapid Flame, we concluded that\nRapid Flame itself could not be produced. I think there was external help.\n\n2. The gun is a gun that fires dense desert energy.\n\n3. Special wires and claws with a 700kg grip are attached with special armor. Special wires are constructed of special materials that allow the storage and transport of soul energy.

One cloudy day.\nThe child's runaway was expected. Rather, they could not understand those who saw the phenomenon and called it a disaster. We have sinned and the time has come to pay for it. It was just a punishment for all the other children. Even if it has the name of revenge, I will accept it as an atonement.\n\nOne snowy day.\nThe child has fallen asleep again by foolish humans. They were sobered with the idea that everything would end when the child fell asleep. We are angry at the folly of thinking that Ned Company will save us. They will bury and kill all who know the truth. As if nothing had happened.\n\nA sunny day.\nThe closure of this place was decided, and the rest of the people were left in this hell. Perhaps not long afterwards all die. okay. This death is suitable for us who have sinned. But strangely, I am not afraid of the coming death.

Model Name: NS_EX_008\nName: Cleany\n\n1. As the name suggests, a dedicated robot for cleaning. Determining soul energy in things. Ideal for separate collection and lost items.\n\n2. Currently in power loss, entering forced sleep mode. Injecting energy three times in sequence releases sleep mode and starts moving.\n(It takes about 24 hours to move.)\n\n3. The core is destroyed or lost. If you find an amplification device that can be used to replace the core and install it in place of the core. Cores can be revived.\n(But only 1% of the power source should remain.\n\nThank you for those who have reached this point following the hint.\nThis is the [person] No one has sinned except for this.\nThis is the case for robots too.\nI think you will accept this child if you come here in response to the words [HELP ME]. Please.\nAnd Cleany. I wish you always happy things.

Even in a deserted cloud forest, an innocent girl plays a fun game with many things in her dreams. What did the girl dream?

ID=40721

There there! Hey!\nSetsuka had very fun dream yesterday.

ID=40722

I went to R-Square where I often went with my dad and sister.

ID=40723

I looked hungry but it was a bit unfortunate that I couldn't give it to Yomi.

ID=40724

The little doll lit a candle! \nI felt happy to greet Setsuka.

ID=40725

The big doll just stroked Setsuka's head. \nI thought it would be cozy to hug your belly!

ID=40726

Big rocks just rolled around \nIt looked very hard.

ID=40727

Setsuka just rolled like this, trying to follow, and i fell down wrong.

ID=40728

But a big rock uncle raised Setsuka up!

ID=40729

The girl with big eyes just looked at me and cried, but she was like Setsuka.

ID=40730

She shook hands, but Setsuka had only two hands, so it was a little difficult.

ID=40731

There was also a strange masked brother, and she was happy to shake her hand because Setsuka shook her hand.

ID=40732

I've seen my brother, who has four arms, and if he has four arms, is it easy to shake hands with the alien?

ID=40733

There was an uncle who looked like our next door, and i'll say hello the next time I see him again.

ID=40734

There was also a lovely sister! It was as beautiful as my sister Miriam! \nI should talk to my sister.

ID=40735

The woodman with the big axe just got angry. \n Not to come here.....

ID=40736

I was a little scared, but I felt like I was worried about Setsuka.

ID=40737

Haaaam... Setsuka is also sleepy. I'll tell you later if I have another funny dream. Bye-bye ...

Akashik Records must have a composite experience of 100% (MAX) before they can be engraved.

By using the same grade of "card cover" as the additional material on the same material as the imprint, you can do "Random Synthesis" to get one of the higher grade cards. \nYou can get new cards through random compositing, cards used can't be retrieved, so use them with care.
