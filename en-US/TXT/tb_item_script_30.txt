<font color='#FFBA85'>[Soul Weapon: Sword]<font color='#9D927B'>\n\nSoul Worker exclusive weapon. The soul of Yorhaka, who devours everything into the void, is made in the form of a sword, almost preserving the eroded debris, and specializes in treating the existence itself as a foreign object and erasing it rather than cutting the opponent. It sucks and moves the soul energy of the user, so if the general public touches it, it is sucked into the soul, leaving only the shell. Used by Haru Estia.

\nIt will shave your soul away. But it would be fine if you were a soul worker who instantly recovered soul energy.

\nIf you get used to it for a long time, you'll feel like fighting without a soul. Then just throw yourself into the emptiness and fight. A monster will appear as long as you want to run for you.
